# HTH-2023-Spotify-Data-Analysis

## Why I was Interested in this Data?
The data that I will be using for this project shows the top streamed tracks in Spotify for 2023. It includes Track title, Artist, Release Date (in Year,Month, and Day), number of Streams on Spotify, and how many times the tracks were in the top charts for deezer, apple music, and shazam playlists. I choose this data set mainly because I was interested in seeing which songs were the most popular and by what artists. I also wanted to see patterns in what decade of music people liked, what artsits, which artists had more success on what platforms. I also really like listening to music and so its nice to see a lot of the artists I listen to be here.
