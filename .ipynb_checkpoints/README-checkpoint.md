# HTH-2023-Spotify-Data-Analysis

## Why I was Interested in this Data?
The data that I will be using for this project shows the top streamed tracks in Spotify for 2023. It includes Track title, Artist, Release Date (in Year,Month, and Day), number of Streams on Spotify, and how many times the tracks were in the top charts for deezer, apple music, and shazam playlists. I choose this data set mainly because I was interested in seeing which songs were the most popular and by what artists. I also wanted to see patterns in what decade of music people liked, what artsits, which artists had more success on what platforms. I also really like listening to music and so its nice to see a lot of the artists I listen to be here.  


## Data Analysis Questions (Brainstorming some Questions that I might do)
### 1. What were the top 5 most popular songs from the 90's? And plot their streams in a bar graph.
### 2. How much streams did Ed Sheran's top 3 songs earn in total? Create a pie chart comparing all three of them. 
### 3. Create a scatterplot showing how release date relates to total streams.
### 4. Create a scatterplot comparing the bpm and streams.
### 4. How much streams did the top 500 artists make in total, compare how much each made using a pie chart.
